### HELLO! ðŸ“¢
I'm JosÃ© Manuel and I'm a javascript developer, although if an interesting and disruptive project that attracts me from another technology, I'm sure I'll go for it!

### âŒ› MY EXPERIENCE
My professional experience as a programmer began in the middle of the 2020 quarantine, when I couldn't find anything and the opportunity arose to participate in a very interesting project for the analysis of industrial processes. Since then I have gone through different sectors and platforms such as a platform focused on food science, an application that processed data through machine learning or web applications of a telecommunications giant like where I am now.

### âœ¨ MY LIKES
Mainly I like to develop everything that is related to nodejs and javascript (and I prefer the backend), where I have more experience is in the stack mean but being a non-conformist person with his knowledge, I always want to be learning technologies that are new to me. For example, I am now behind react, react native and nestjs.

### ðŸ“– SUMMARY
To summarize, I love to develop from 0 to the end, take an idea, make it mine and sow it until I can harvest it.

### ðŸ”— WOULD YOU BE INTERESTED IN TALKING TO ME?
