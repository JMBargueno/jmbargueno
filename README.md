### Hi! Im Jose Manuel

Im a rookie developer who loves the backend. I have recently finished my degree which has an EQF 5 level.

I have most experience on the MEAN Stack, developing APIs and clients but I have also used java and kotlin for backend and Android´s apps.

- 🎓 I'm currently learning React and I want to start with Flutter. 
- 🔍 I am looking to work in MEAN Stack or backend with java or kotlin but I am open to any other challenge
